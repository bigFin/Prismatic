# Prismatic is open-source software / hardware for photobiology research 
Prismatic was designed and built by **Finlay A.A. Small** in association with the the AMP Jones Lab and the Gosling Research institute for Plant Preservation at *The University of Guelph*.
I make tools that make plant science research easy.


## What is Prismatic?
### Prismatic Pulse: a multi-channel LED driver
A multi-channel constant-voltage LED driver built on NodeMCU
Has a swanky wifi-programmable UI for programming advanced schedules

### Prismatic Photon: a multi-channel LED array
A 9 channel LED array designed for the WeVitro dogBox tissue culture bioreactor

### How is Prismatic used?
I built Prismatic to optimize light spectrum for organogenesis and regeneration in tissue culture. I use the Central Composite Rotatable Design to generate a response surface and find the optimum mixture of spectra. I then validate this using replicated studies. 

## How did I make this stuff?
* **Programming** C, C++, HTML, and JQuery on NodeMCU
* **Circuit design** Eagle
* **PCB fabrication**
* **PCB assembly**
